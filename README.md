# Sentiment-Analysis-using-RNN


Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) come to the forefront when capturing sequential information is crucial, such as in time series analysis, next-word prediction, or sentiment analysis. 
RNNs excel at capturing sequential information, allowing them to understand context rather than just individual words. 
Leveraging TensorFlow's capabilities, we embark on sentiment analysis, tapping into RNNs to discern the underlying sentiments expressed in textual data. 
We will develop models using Recurrent Neural Networks for Sentiment Analysis to understand text classification using Tensorflow!
